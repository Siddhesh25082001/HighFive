## Problem Statement

Communication has been a struggle for everyone since the outbreak and in the aftermath, People with physical or intellectual challenges are unable to use video conferencing apps and interfaces

This calls for the development of Web-based Video Chat Applications that can assist those who are unable to communicate verbally and/or use conventional mouse/keyboard inputs but yet need to emotionally connect with others across a distance

## Solution

- A Video conferencing application that is Free and Accessible for all
- Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) in video conferencing by appending 4 Modes to the video chat app that can help differently abled individuals have access to and communicate with the people who are important to them
